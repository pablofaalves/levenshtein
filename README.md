## Levenshtein algorithm implementation

This small java application calculates the levenshtein distance between two strings with optimized memory allocation.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

## Compiling

run `javac com/quoori/levenshtein/*.java` on your shell inside the 'src' folder


## Running the application

run `java com.quoori.levenshtein.Main arg0 arg1` on your shell, where arg0 and arg1 are the words which you'd like know the levenshtein distance.

If you don't use any arguments, it will run a default test case.
